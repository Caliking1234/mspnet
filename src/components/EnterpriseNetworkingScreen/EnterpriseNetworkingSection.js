            “Enterprise network” denotes the IT infrastructure that midsize and
            large organizations use to provide connectivity among users,
            devices, and applications. The goal is to support the organizations’
            objectives by consistently delivering connected digital services
            reliably and securely to workers, partners, customers, and,
            increasingly, also things.

              In addition to security applications and devices, such as
              firewalls and secure Internet gateways, an enterprise network
              becomes a primary detector of threats and an enforcer of security
              and compliance. It does so with device identification, profiling,
              and verification, network monitoring, authentication, access
              controls, segmentation, and device and account management.

              wireless connectivity for more users and IoT devices in more
              settings. At the same time, 400 Gbps is the new standard for

              Increasingly, network management is being automated, with software

              or potential threats and respond automatically. Artificial
              intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), and machine reasoning
              (MR) are now making networks smarter by adapting to the unique

              More and more enterprises are aligning their networks to
              intent-based networking (IBN) principles. Intent-based networks
              use advanced analytics along with software-defined networking
              (SDN)-based automation to continuously align network performance
              to changing business needs. They capture business intent,
              translate it into policies that can be applied consistently across
              the network, and continuously monitor and adjust network
              performance to help achieve desired business outcomes.

              Widespread mobility and cloud adoption require an enhanced
              approach to protecting users, applications, and data. A zero-trust
              security framework helps to prevent unauthorized access, contain
              breaches, and reduce the risk of an attacker’s lateral movement
              through the network.
