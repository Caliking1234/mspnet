            <b>Manage the infrastructure installation</b> – For new circuits,
            our project managers take over interfacing with the local carriers
            and handle the installation of all local loops. We communicate with
            site contacts and make the necessary arrangements.

            reception. We work with the vendors to schedule equipment delivery
            and ensure receipt at the location. We then follow up to ensure
            timely installation of the equipment by contractually agreed-to
            responsible parties.

            tested, verified, and approved, we arrange a cut-over time with your
            operations team. We then work closely with your staff to ensure a
            smooth transition to your new WAN.
