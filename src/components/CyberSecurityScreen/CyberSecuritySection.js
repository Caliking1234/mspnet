          When most companies consider SD-WAN, they often think only about
          reducing MPLS costs and making their network more resilient. Our
          philosophy is that security should be an inherent part of the
          solution. While firewalls have their part in this solution, there is
          more to consider in securing your network. You want to consider all
          your security needs as part of the solution.
